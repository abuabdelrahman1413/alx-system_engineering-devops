## Description

The image depicts a secure and scalable web infrastructure for www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

* **Firewalls (3x):** These act as the first line of defense, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules. They block unauthorized access and protect the web servers from malicious attacks.
* **Load Balancer (HAProxy):** HAProxy distributes incoming HTTPS requests evenly across the two web servers, ensuring efficient load handling and preventing any single server from becoming overloaded.
* **Servers (2x Nginx):** Each server runs Nginx (web server) and a PHP application server. This redundancy ensures continuous operation even if one server fails. 
* **Application Files (PHP Code Base):** The PHP scripts and other code files reside on these servers and are executed by the application server to generate dynamic web content.
* **Database (MySQL):** The MySQL database stores the website's data, such as user information or product details. It's crucial for website functionality and is secured by the firewalls.
* **Monitoring Clients (3x Sumologic):** These clients collect performance data from various components (servers, database) and send it to Sumologic, a monitoring service. This enables proactive identification and resolution of potential issues.
* **HTTPS Certificate:** Encrypts communication between the web browser and the web servers. This safeguards sensitive data (login credentials, credit card information) from being intercepted during transmission.
* **DNS:** The Domain Name System translates the human-readable domain name (www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]) into the machine-readable IP address that allows users to access the website.

## Explanation of Key Elements

* **Firewalls:** 
    * **Purpose:** Filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined security rules.
    * **Benefit:** Block unauthorized access and malicious attacks, enhancing overall security.
* **Load Balancer (HAProxy):**
    * **Function:** Distributes HTTPS requests across the web servers in a Round Robin fashion.
    * **Advantage:** Ensures efficient load handling and prevents server overload.
* **HTTPS Certificate:**
    * **Functionality:** Encrypts communication between browsers and servers. 
    * **Benefit:** Protects sensitive data transmission, fostering trust and security.
* **Monitoring Clients:**
    * **Role:** Collect performance data from various components.
    * **Value:** Enables proactive monitoring and identification of potential issues that could impact website functionality.

## Design Advantages

* **Security:** Firewalls and HTTPS provide robust security measures against unauthorized access and data breaches.
* **Scalability:** The load balancer and redundant servers allow for handling increased traffic volumes effectively.
* **Reliability:** Redundancy in servers and firewalls minimizes downtime risks in case of component failures.
* **Performance:** Load balancing ensures efficient traffic distribution, optimizing performance.
* **Monitoring:** Proactive monitoring helps identify and address issues promptly, maintaining website uptime and user experience.

## Potential Improvements

* **Database Redundancy:** While not depicted, implementing a master-slave replication setup for the MySQL database can further enhance reliability by providing a backup in case of the primary server failure.

This design prioritizes security, scalability, and reliability while providing performance optimization through load balancing. The inclusion of monitoring allows for proactive management and ensures a smooth user experience. The suggested improvement regarding database redundancy would further strengthen the infrastructure's resilience.
