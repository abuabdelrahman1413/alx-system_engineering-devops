## Description

The image shows a high-level overview of a simple web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed].

**Components:**

* **Server:** A computer program or hardware that provides services to other computers (clients).
* **Domain Name:** A human-readable alias for an IP address (e.g., www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed] vs. 192.168.1.1). The mapping between domain names and IP addresses is handled by the Domain Name System (DNS).
* **DNS Record:** A specific record type in DNS that maps a domain name to an IP address. In this case, www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed] likely uses an A record (verifiable with `dig www.foobar.com`).
* **Web Server:** Software or hardware that accepts requests (HTTP or HTTPS) from clients and delivers the requested web pages or content, or an error message if the request cannot be fulfilled.
* **Database:** Stores the website's data, such as user information or product details, allowing for easy access, management, and updates.

## Issues With This Infrastructure:

* **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** This infrastructure has several SPOFs. If any critical component (e.g., web server, database) fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
* **Downtime During Maintenance:** Maintenance on any component requires taking the server offline, leading to website downtime.
* **Limited Scalability:**  This single-server architecture cannot handle significant increases in traffic. The server can become overloaded and slow down, or even run out of resources.

**Additional Considerations for Scalability:**

* **Proxy Servers:** Can improve performance and reduce load on the main web server by caching frequently accessed content.
* **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers, preventing any single server from becoming overloaded.
