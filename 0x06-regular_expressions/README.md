# Regular Expression Project

---

## Introduction
This project focuses on building regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, which is the default regular expression library used by Ruby. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation of strings. In this project, you'll develop regular expressions to match specific patterns within strings.

## Usage
To use the provided Ruby script `example.rb`, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `example.rb` file.
3. Run the script using Ruby, passing the string you want to match as a command-line argument.

Example:
```bash
./example.rb 127.0.0.2
