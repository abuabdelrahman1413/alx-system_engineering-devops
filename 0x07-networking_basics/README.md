# 0x07. Networking basics #0

## Description
This project covers the basics of networking including the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, and more.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the following:
- OSI Model
- LAN and WAN networks
- Internet and IP addresses
- TCP and UDP protocols
- Ports and their usage
- ICMP and its role in network diagnostics

## Resources
Read or watch:
- OSI model
- Different types of networks
- LAN network
- WAN network
- Internet
- MAC address
- IP address
- IPv4 and IPv6
- TCP and UDP
- TCP/UDP ports
- ping / ICMP
- Positional parameters

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All Bash script files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without any error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

## Tasks
- **0-OSI_model:** Introduction to the OSI model.
- **1-types_of_network:** Different types of networks.
- **2-MAC_and_IP_address:** Understanding MAC and IP addresses.
- **3-UDP_and_TCP:** Exploring UDP and TCP protocols.
- **4-TCP_and_UDP_ports:** Writing a Bash script to display listening ports.
- **5-is_the_host_on_the_network:** Writing a Bash script to ping an IP address.

## Usage
To execute the Bash scripts, run `./script_name` in your terminal. Make sure the script files have execute permissions.
